# Welcome

Welcome to the **Verida AI** developer documentation!

Here, you’ll find everything you need to integrate Verida’s AI developer tools into your application.

Verida AI allows users to easily and quickly connect their private data from other applications into your application or AI product. Once integrated, your AI application can access a user's Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Telegram and much more.

{% hint style="success" %}
See [how-it-works.md](getting-started/how-it-works.md "mention")to learn how your application can easily access user's data.
{% endhint %}

### Why Build with Verida?

* **Easy Data Access**: With a single integration gain access to user data across many different platforms and data sources.
* **Flexible Integration**: Use our [personalagentkit.md](integrations/personalagentkit.md "mention") integrations (such as [langgraph.md](integrations/langgraph.md "mention")) or use our REST APIs directly for server or client-side applications.
* **User-Owned Data**: Allow your application to access user data, while keeping users in control of their data, enhancing privacy and trust.
* **GDPR Compliant**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA and other data privacy regulations by only accessing user data on demand to drastically reduce your application's security overhead.
* **Granular Permissions**: Precisely control access with scopes, ensuring minimal data exposure.
* **Decentralized Identity**: Seamlessly manage decentralized identities across applications.
* **Open Source**: Work with open-source, community driven software.&#x20;

### Getting Started

1. [how-it-works.md](getting-started/how-it-works.md "mention"): Learn the flow of how your application can gain access to data directly from users
2. [**Developer Console**](https://admin.verida.ai/): Open the developer console, an easy to use interface to generate authorization requests and use APIs.
3. [**Check Your Scopes**](getting-started/scopes.md): Decide which data or APIs your application needs access to, and request only the necessary scopes.
4. **Implement Authentication**: Set up a "Connect Verida" button in your application so users can grant you the required permissions.
5. **Integrate with your application:**
   1. [**Use LangGraph tools**](integrations/langgraph.md): Quickly expand the capabilities of your LLM with our pre-built LangGraph tools that can access all available user data.
   2. [**Use the APIs**](data-apis/overview.md): Make calls to the Verida User APIs with a valud user `auth_token` .
6. [**Explore Examples**](getting-started/example-apps.md): Head to our code samples and tutorials to see best practices in action.
