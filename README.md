# Welcome

Welcome to the **Verida AI** developer documentation!

Here, you’ll find everything you need to integrate Verida’s decentralized data platform into your application. Verida empowers developers and users alike with secure, user-owned data storage, identity management, and a suite of powerful APIs.

### Why Build with Verida?

* **User-Owned Data**: Allow your application to access user data, while keeping users in control of their data, enhancing privacy and trust.
* **Easy Data Access**: With a single integration gain access to user data across many different platforms and data sources.
* **GDPR Compliant**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, HIPAA and other data privacy regulations by only accessing user data on demand to drastically reduce your application's security overhead.
* **Flexible Integration**: Use our JavaScript, TypeScript, or REST-based libraries for server or client-side applications.
* **Granular Permissions**: Precisely control access with scopes, ensuring minimal data exposure.
* **Decentralized Identity**: Seamlessly manage decentralized identities across applications.
* **Open Source**: Work with open-source, community driven software.&#x20;

### Getting Started

1. [**Developer Console**](https://admin.verida.ai/): Open the developer console, an easy to use interface to generate authorization requests and use APIs.
2. **Check Your Scopes**: Decide which data or APIs your application needs access to, and request only the necessary scopes.
3. **Implement Authentication**: Set up a "Connect Verida" button in your application so users can grant you the required permissions.
4. **Use the APIs**: Make calls to the Verida User APIs, providing your valid `auth_token` in the `Authorization` header.
5. [**Explore Examples**](getting-started/example-apps.md): Head to our code samples and tutorials to see best practices in action.
