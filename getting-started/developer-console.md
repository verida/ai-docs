The Verida AI [Developer Console](https://admin.verida.ai/) is the central hub for managing your Verida developer account, monitoring your application usage, and interacting with our API ecosystem. This guide will walk you through the key capabilities and features of the console, empowering you to build, test, and deploy applications using the Verida platform.

### Creating Your Verida Account

Before diving into development, you must create a Verida account to manage your developer account. This account will serve as your identity within the Verida ecosystem and unlock access to various features of the developer console.

**Steps to Create Your Account:**

1. **Install Verida Wallet:** Visit the [Verida Wallet](https://www.verida.network/verida-wallet) page to download the Verida Wallet.
2. **Create Verida Account:** Within the wallet, create your decentralized Verida account and backup your seed phrase.
3. **Log In:** Once setup, scan the QR code in the [Developer Console](https://admin.verida.ai/) to get started.

### Registering as a Developer

After setting up your Verida account, take the next step by registering as a developer. This process provides you with free credits to experiment with and develop your applications.

**How to Register as a Developer:**

1. **Login:** Login to the Developer Console and navigate to the Dashboard.
2. **Register Developer Account:** Click on the "Register as a Developer" button.
3. **Receive Free Credits:** Once verified, your account will be credited with free API credits, enabling you to start building and testing your applications immediately.

### Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is your control center within the Verida AI Developer Console. It offers real-time insights and detailed metrics about your application's performance and usage.

**Key Metrics Displayed:**

* **Credit Balance:** Monitor the number of free credits available for API requests.
* **API Requests:** Track the number of API calls made by your application.
* **User Connections:** See how many users have connected to your application, giving you a snapshot of your app’s engagement and reach.

This overview helps you manage resources effectively and plan for scaling your applications as usage grows.

### Developer Sandbox

The Developer Sandbox is a powerful feature designed to facilitate experimentation and streamline your development process. It provides a secure, controlled environment where you can perform a variety of tasks.

#### Features of the Developer Sandbox

1. **Build Auth Requests:**
   * Create authentication requests to obtain auth tokens for accessing user data.
   * Customize request parameters and scopes to fit your application’s needs.
2. **Manage API Scopes:**
   * List all available API scopes.
   * Add, modify, or remove scopes as required.
   * Understand the permissions each scope provides for granular access control.
3. **Make API Requests:**
   * Test your API endpoints directly from the sandbox.
   * Validate responses and debug issues in real time.
   * Ensure your requests are correctly formatted and authenticated.
4. **Browse Data with an Auth Token:**
   * Use your obtained auth tokens to query and browse data.
   * Visualize and inspect data returned from your API calls.
   * Confirm data integrity and response structures before deploying to production.

The sandbox is an essential tool that enables you to build, test, and refine your application logic without affecting your live environment.
