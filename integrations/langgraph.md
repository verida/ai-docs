Chatbot example using Verida PersonalAgentKit with Langchain
{% endembed %}

Our first release supports typescript LangGraph tools to easily integrate with any LangChain / LangGraph application.

You can locally run the [Command Line Chat Bot](https://github.com/verida/personal-agent-kit/tree/main/typescript/examples/chatbot) to access your data stored in your [verida-vault.md](../resources/verida-vault.md "mention") to experiment and learn what is possible.

You can integrate these tools into your existing LangGraph / LangChain project, see the [README file for the LangGraph typescript tools library](https://github.com/verida/personal-agent-kit/blob/main/typescript/extensions/langchain/README.md) for example code snippets and instructions.

{% hint style="info" %}
We currently only support typescript, but will gladly award a [grant](../resources/grants.md) to anyone who implements a Python library.
